          <h2>Personal info</h2>
          <p>
            My interest in computers started when I was in Grade 10 at the
            Mathematics, Science and Technology School. As a subject, I chose
            CAT (Computer Application Technology), and ever since then I've
            always been fascinated by computers. My peers and other IT learners
            would always talk about coding languages at school and that got me
            interested in coding.
